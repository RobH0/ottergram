## How It's Made

**Tech used:** EJS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

**Dependencies:** bcrypt, connect-mongo, dotenv, ejs, express, express-session, mongodb, passport, passport-local, express-flash, multer, cloudinary.

The web app was developed using an MVC design pattern for future scalability and maintainability. The front end was created using EJS and styled using CSS, providing a responsive design for mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop users. On the back end, Node.js and Express.js are used to handle and respond to REST API requests made while the user interacts with the web app's front end in their browser. MongoDB is used to store data relating to user profiles, posts, likes, comments, and user sessions.

## Future Improvements/Optimizations

Given more time, I would like to make the following improvements:
- Add a notification system that notifies a user when another user likes or comments on one of their posts.
- Implement a direct message feature that would allow users to directly text chat with one another.
- Provide authenticated users with the ability to search for other users' profiles via a search bar.
- Alter profile settings to include an option allowing the authenticated user to delete their account.
- Improve design for mobiles and tablets.
- Refactor code.
- Design landing page.
